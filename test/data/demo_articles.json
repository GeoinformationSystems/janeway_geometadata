Researchers conducted statistical analysis using threshold values and five novel building indexes, combined with GIS spatial analysis. The work identifies that the historical center of Guarda was consolidated in the 1960s and, since then, has been relatively unchanged. Results demonstrate suitable spatial alignment with consolidated urban areas and official Urban Rehabilitation Area boundaries.",
